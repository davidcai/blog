It is the end of an era. After almost 8-year service at Financial Engines, I decided to advance my career in a different place. The decision is definitely not easy. Leaving FE is like carving out a big chunk of my life. So many familiar faces, so many beautiful memories. However, as of today, I still believe that when facing a great opportunity, I'd rather give it my best try than having the regrets of inaction.

Looking back, I'm proud to be a part of this great journey. During these 8 years, we went though two waves of technology evolutions at FE.

The first one is when I joined FE in 2008, we renovated the legacy Servlet UI to Struts 2, FreeMarker, Flash, Yahoo! UI, and JWPlayer. This was when we created those three drawers and complicate sliders in the Dashboard page. And everything started from there.

The second wave is two and half years ago to present. It all began with this 'Angularity' experiment -- a small proof of concept to bridge legacy Struts UI with modern Angular JS and Bootstrap. Today we called it the hybrid mode, a stepping stone to pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front end. Later, a Hackathon project pushed things even further. Single Page Application (SPA) had its debut at FE. Then, one year ago, a group of developers led by Alex Y created the foundation of SPA development workflow. The first ever SPA CICD pipeline was born at that time. GIT was introduced to wide audience. Macbook, Gulp, Bower, Node JS, Optimizely, SauceLabs, App Dynamics, Analytics, Loggly, Jasmine, Protractor, and C3/D3 all happened within that short period. Things just got exploded ... in a good way :)

Now, I'm confident to make an assertion here, that our front end technologies of today can compete head to head with any unicorn company's. We are at the head.
